# chrome-speechifier
Speechifier is a simple, silent Chrome extension that makes every text box a voice input box. Using this extension you can talk to your browser and have it type the words you say on the page.  It utilizes Chrome's built-in but heavily underrated Web Speech API by adding the "x-webkit-speech" attribute to qualifying HTML elements on the page.
